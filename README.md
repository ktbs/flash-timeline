This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
generic timeline visualisation for activity traces.

It depends on the com.ithaca.traces package, which can be obtained
from the http://github.com/oaubert/astraces1 repository (Traces.swc
component). The swc file must be placed (or linked) in the lib/
directory for compilation of the Timeline.swc component.

To compile examples, both Timeline.swc and Traces.swc components must
be copied or linked in the lib/ directory of each example.
